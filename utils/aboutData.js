      title: 'Introduction',
      content:
        "Welcome! I'm Chris French, a programmer with a diverse portfolio and a unique background in philosophy. My academic training has instilled rigorous problem-solving skills, crucial in navigating complex technological challenges. Having worked at tech giants like Microsoft and Esri, and explored industries as varied as medical, insurance, and GIS, I bring a broad perspective to problem-solving. Currently, I am deeply immersed in the field of data science, fascinated by advanced models such as ChatGPT that can generate nuanced, human-like text.",

      title: 'Full Stack Developer',
      content:
        "I've spent several years honing my full-stack development skills, working on both backend and frontend aspects of various projects. I have used an array of modern technologies, languages, and frameworks to build complex and efficient systems. On the frontend, I have used Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and React Flow for web development. On the backend, I have leveraged Node, Python, and SQL for robust and reliable database management. My extensive experience with AWS Cloud Computing, Docker, Linux, RESTful Microservices and APIs further strengthens my ability to build and manage comprehensive web applications. My proficiency in these areas is evident in my projects, including this very webpage you're viewing, and my ability to build REST API-based PaaS, as demonstrated in my work at Esri."

      title: 'Academic Background',
      content:
        "My journey to the tech industry began in academia, where I pursued philosophy. During my PhD studies at the University of British Columbia, I delved into the history of analytic philosophy and the philosophy of science, focusing on thinkers like Rudolf Carnap. His work on inductive logic, which has influenced modern Statistical Bayesian Decision Theory, aligns with my interest in the statistical aspects of AI. This unique intersection of philosophy and technology guides my approach to problem-solving in data engineering and AI."

      title: 'Current Projects',
      content:
        "I'm always exploring new ways to integrate my academic interests with my tech skills. I'm engrossed in simulation and evolutionary game theory, working with languages like Rust, Nim, and actively learning C++ 17. I find it exciting to experiment with game engines like Unreal Engine 5 and Godot in my spare time. I'm currently working on a small game engine project using C++ for the Vulkan API, which has been an excellent opportunity to apply my C++ 17 knowledge. As I continue to build on my coding repertoire, my current work and projects offer a thrilling blend of philosophy, science, and technology, illustrating the limitless possibilities at this intersection."
